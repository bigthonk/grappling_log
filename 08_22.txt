Did Squat workout around 4, need to push this earlier to give myself more time to recover before rolling.
Worked on getting to x guard from spider guard as the positional movement today. I never find myself in spider guard. I should start moving to it from closed guard with white belts.
Worked points training, did well against everyone except Proffesor Gabe.
Need to continue to press more aggresively on the feet. 
Will rewatch the Danaher feet to floor series again.
